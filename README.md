# GetGrainSize
[Material Science] Measure grain size based on the Heyn intercept method.

![sample](https://github.com/kyphd/GetGrainSize/blob/master/output/000.png)

# About
This program is to measure the grain size based on the Heyn intercept method [E. Heyn, The Metallographist, Vol. 5, 1903, pp. 39-64.]. A monochrome image file is required and grain boundary is described with black line. If you want to crop some images from original one, you can use "Crop mode" in which some images are cropped randomly and the grain size are measured for each cropped image.

# Require
## python 3

https://www.python.org/

## module
numpy, pillow are required.
```
pip install numpy pillow
```

## Image file

You need to prepare the monochrome image file in which grain boundaries are shown with black line.

# Execute

```
python getgrainsize.py -f <filename> -l <l> -c -s <width> <height> -n <n>
```

Each option is separated by space. 

## options

-f \<filename\> : Image filename. \[mandatory\]

-l \<l:int\> : Number of lines to measure grain size. \[mandatory\]

-c : Crop mode. Some images are croped from image file randomely, and measure the grain size for each cropped file. \[optional\]

-s \<width\> \<height\> : Width and height of cropped image. \[mandatory for crop mode (-c)\]

-n \<n\> : Number of crop images. \[mandatory for crop mode (-c)\]

## example 1

To measure the grain size in sample.tif, run getgrainsize.py as follows.

```
python getgrainsize.py -f sample.tif -l 5
```

## example 2

If you want 3 crop images (width and height is (200, 200)) from sample.tif, and want to measure each grain size, run as follows.

```
python getgrainsize.py -f sample.tif -l 5 -c -s 200 200 -n 3
```

# output

"output" directory is made and result files are saved.

result.dat : Results are saved in this file. The same as STDOUT. D_x is the average grain size measured by line no.x (x = 0, 1, 2,...). D_ave is the average grain size from the image.

\<filename\> : The copy of the original image file. Lines and interceptions are shown. As for the crop mode, the cropped areas are shown in this file.

000.tif, 001.tif, ... : For the crop mode, cropped images are generaged. Lines and interceptions are shown.
